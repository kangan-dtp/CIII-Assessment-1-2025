    "1. **Add batteries to the inventory**  \n",
    "   - Record the quantity of batteries added along with the date of addition.\n",
    "2. **Install batteries**  \n",
    "   - Record the quantity of batteries installed, the car registration, and the date of installation.\n",
    "3. **View current inventory levels**  \n",
    "   - Display the total number of batteries currently in stock.\n",
    "4. **View usage history**  \n",
    "   - Display a history of all batteries added and installed, including dates and car registrations.\n",
    "5. **Exit the program**  \n",

    "- When batteries are added, the program records the quantity and the date of addition.  \n",
    "- When batteries are installed, the program checks if there is enough quantity in stock. If not, it displays a warning message and does not allow the transaction. When installing batteries, the program records the quantity installed, the car registration, and the date of installation.  \n",
